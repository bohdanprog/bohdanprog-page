    title: 'A Year of Change â€“ My Journey Through Three Roles',
    description: `This past year has been a wild ride! After my time as a fullstack engineer at Blocklabs, I found myself in search of new challenges, which led me to change jobs three times.
First, I dived into the world of frontend development, where my focus was all about creating a better user experience and making sure everything was solid through extensive testing. Then, I switched gears to work as a React Native engineer, maintaining and improving three mobile appsâ€”definitely a challenge, but one that taught me a lot.
Now, Iâ€™m excited to say Iâ€™ve found my groove as a Software Engineer at Software Mansion. Iâ€™m focusing on mobile apps using React Native and even maintaining the react-native-svg open-source library. Itâ€™s been a year of growth, and Iâ€™m loving where Iâ€™ve landed.`,
